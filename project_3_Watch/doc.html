    <h1>Dcoument</h1>

    <h3>Idea</h3>
    <p>
        Two samurai (or sword wielding people) battling against each other. 
        <br>Goal is to parry as long as possible while seeking the chance to attack them
        <br>The speed of the enemy increases as time passes.
    </p>

    <h3>Platform</h3>
    <P>
        Mostly pc, but mobile does seem compatiable with idea.
    </P>

    <h3>Style (art, animation, etc)</h3>
    <p>
        maybe simple and quick ms paint or pixel art of some kind
    </p>

    <h3>Details, Progression, etc</h3>
    <p>
        I'm thinking of something like two sprite with spritesheets for animation
        <br>It's more of a time based than a collision checking base, but collision checking might be needed
        <br>System will be looking for inputs in a specific time window when the enemy gets ready to attack with signal of some sort.
        <br>There will be 3 different attacks with cooldowns and attack power. However, perfect parry (something like perfectly timed 
            "attack" against attack)
        <br>
    </p>
    <p> As for progression and score, maybe points based on total time to defeat enemy/total time survived. 
        Speed of attacks will increase. Possible with random or something</p>

    <h4>Concept Image</h4>
    <img src="images/concept_image.png" alt="concept art of proposal">

    <p>As shown above, two sprite facing each other with swords or sticks.</p>
    <p>There will be 3 attacks: normal, heavy, special</p>
    <p>Each attacks has certain dmg. heavy against normal will result in a stunned effect.</p>
    <p>I plan on doing "animation"(or something) to indicate the type of attack</p>
    <p>There will be health points and maybe a guage for special attack. I also plan on litle icons and timer for types of attacks.</p>

    <h2>Progression</h2>
    <a href="about.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Link to about page</a>
    <p>The idea is CHANGED to some kind of horror arcade game. [described in proposal page] <br>
        Stay alive as long as possible while getting the highest score you can get.<br>
        There will be a leader that allows the user to record themselves (THO I'm kind of scared of people putting inappropriate names)
